# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic Tic Tac Toe game built with PyGame - my first step into game development!

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aysieelf/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
